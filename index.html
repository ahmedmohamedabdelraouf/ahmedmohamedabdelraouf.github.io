        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p id="grill">Soak the capers in a bowl of water. Squeeze all the lemon juice into a large shallow bowl and add 4 tablespoons of oil. Peel the garlic and finely chop with the chilli, anchovies, pistachios, drained capers and mint leaves. Scrape it all into the bowl and mix together well.

Reserving the tentacles, run a sharp knife down the length of each squid tube, cutting through one side only so you can open each one out like a book. Lightly score the inside of each tube in a criss-cross fashion at ½cm intervals. To cook the squid, follow Franchina’s guidance and get the tentacles on early, then add the tubes, from largest to smallest. In a screaming hot griddle pan or on a barbecue, cook each piece for about 1 minute per side – with no oil or seasoning – until lightly charred and starting to curl. Start with the cut side when you do the tubes, and keep the squid moving for even cooking. As each piece is done, use tongs to dunk it straight into the salsa, turning and coating it in all that flavour.

Slice the tomatoes and lay over a serving platter. Finely slice the squid tubes, pull the tentacles apart, then arrange on top of the tomatoes. Spoon over all the remaining salsa, and serve hot or at room temperature.</p>

<h1>Pot-roast cauliflower</h1>

    </tr>
</table>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Peel and quarter the onions, then pick the quarters apart into petals straight into a 20cm-wide, deep ovenproof pan on a medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the anchovies and stir occasionally while you peel and slice the garlic. Squash the olives, leaving the stones in, then stir into the pan with the garlic. Cook and stir for 2 minutes, then pour in the wine and add the saffron, if using.

Trim the base of the cauliflower, then use a sharp knife to carefully score a deep cross into the stalk. Remove only any tatty outer leaves, leaving the rest intact. Sit the cauliflower in the pan, stalk side down, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spoon some of the onions and liquid over the cauliflower, then bring to the boil and carefully transfer the pan to the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender (check by inserting a sharp knife). Baste it with the pan juices twice during cooking.

Carefully lift the cauliflower on to a platter and spoon over the soft onions, olives and fragrant juices from the pan. Slice, and serve.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p id="chicken">
Trim the aubergines, chop into random 5cm chunks and wedges, place in a large bowl and season generously from a height with sea salt. Put aside.

Drizzle all the chicken pieces with oil, place in a large shallow pan on a medium-high heat, skin side down, to get golden on all sides, then remove to a large platter. Wipe the salt off the aubergines and add to the pan, turning until lightly golden on all sides. Remove the aubergines to the platter and reduce the heat under the pan to low. Peel and slice the garlic, prick the chillies and place both in the pan with the cinnamon, woody herbs and capers. Stir and fry for a couple of minutes while you peel and finely slice the onions, then stir them into the pan, too. Cook for 15 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring occasionally.

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Squeeze the tomatoes in a bowl of water to remove the seeds – a fine nonna trick to prevent you getting splattered – then tear them into the pan. Put the chicken and aubergines back in, drizzle over any resting juices, then pour in 600ml of water. Sprinkle over the pine nuts, then squeeze over the lemon juice. Cook at the bottom of the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden. Pick over the basil leaves and serve with a nice big bowl of lemony couscous.</p>
